# free-photo-searcher.github.io
An app using HTML, CSS and JS to search and download photos from Pexels.com

Using the Pexels API, this is a simple app that allows a subject search(i.e. "cats") for free photos on Pexels.com .

The name of the photographer will display and link you to their Pexels page when clicked.

You may then choose to download the photo (the original size of the photo will download).

There is also a handy link to Pexels.com right under the title.

This is based off of a tutorial by "DevelopedByEd" in his Creative JS course.

It may come in handy. Thanks for checking it out!
